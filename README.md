# Kaggle-Rossmann
Repo for Kaggle Rossmann sales prediction competition

One of my personal best performances where I finished 28th, at a striking distance from the top 3 ranked scores. 

For the most part, I used very simple models and my language of choice back then was R. I eventually switched to Python towards the end of the competition. 

One of the best scoring model for me was my very first submission - a simple median sales prediciton based on the day of the week and if a sales promotion was on or not.
